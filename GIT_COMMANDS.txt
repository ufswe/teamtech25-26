GIT CHEATSHEET (STUDENT VERSION)

IMPORTANT RULES
• Do NOT create your own branch unless a team lead tells you to. 
• Do NOT push directly to main unless your team lead approves. 
• Always pull before you start working. 
• If something breaks, ask before forcing anything.
• BEFORE you start writing code, make sure you know what branch you should be working on.

If you are unsure of WHERE you should push your code (main or a different branch),
please ask your team lead, Cara or Elise. Please do not assume!

  ------------------------------
  BASIC WORKFLOW (MOST COMMON)
  ------------------------------

1.  Make sure you are up to date (will either say up to date or show changes)
`git pull origin main`

2.  Check status (what files changed?) 
`git status`

3.  Add your changes 
`git add .`

4.  Commit your changes 
`git commit -m “Describe what you changed”`

5.  Push your changes (ONLY if allowed) 
`git push -u origin branch-name`


  ----------------------------
  BRANCHING (READ CAREFULLY)
  ----------------------------

You should ONLY create or switch branches if your team lead tells you
to.

To check what branch you are on: `git branch`

To switch to an existing branch: `git checkout branch-name`

To create a new branch (ONLY if instructed): `git checkout -b
new-branch-name`

To push your branch to GitHub: `git push -u origin new-branch-name`
(you must push YOUR branch to github before you can push TO your branch)

  ----------------------
  UPDATING YOUR BRANCH
  ----------------------

Before working each day: `git pull origin main`

If you’re on another branch: `git pull origin branch-name`

  ---------------------------
  MERGING (TEAM LEADS ONLY)
  ---------------------------
Switch to main: git checkout main
Merge branch: git merge branch-name

  ----------------
  UNDOING THINGS
  ----------------

Unstage a file: git reset file.txt
Discard local changes: git checkout – file.txt
Undo last commit (careful): git reset –soft HEAD~1

  ------------------
  HELPFUL COMMANDS
  ------------------

See commit history: git log –oneline
See differences: git diff
See remote: git remote -v

-----------
EMERGENCY
-----------
If you’re confused or see errors: STOP and ask your team lead. Do NOT
force push. Do NOT delete branches.
